## TechOps Fullstack Technical Test 2024

## Objective

The purpose of this test is to evaluate skills in React interface development and Node.js API, as well as the ability to efficiently handle a CSV file. The candidate must create a user interface for uploading a CSV file, send it to a Node.js API that processes the file, and then return the zipped result to the client.

The CSV file is available at that link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MG0MoczOYM-UoFsEQN8ThRyyG3aH4v4Y/view?usp=sharing

## Front-End Section (React)

- Create a simple React interface with a single page containing a CSV file upload form.
- Display a progress indicator during the file upload.
- Manage upload errors by displaying an appropriate error message.

## Back-End Section (Node.js)

- Set up a Node.js API with a route to receive the CSV file.
- The route should be capable of efficiently handling a CSV file.
- The file should be separated into two CSV files based on gender.
- The result must be compressed (zipped) before being sent back to the client.
- Manage errors.
